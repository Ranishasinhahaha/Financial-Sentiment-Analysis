# Financial Sentiment Analysis  
This project analyzes the sentiment in financial texts, such as news articles and reports, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify whether a given financial text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in finance by providing insights into market sentiments derived from textual data. This can aid in predicting stock market trends, improving investment strategies, and identifying potential risks.
- Preprocessing raw financial text data.
- Applying machine learning models for sentiment classification.
- Visualizing sentiment trends in financial datasets.
- Dataset: [Financial Sentiments]
- Size: X rows, Y columns  
- Content: Columns include 'Text', 'Sentiment', etc.
